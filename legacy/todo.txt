add a highlight for the game info page custom conquer limit table to show where it's currently at... just like the custom trade table
although it will be a bit trickier as it's based on several different attributes of the game


make the custom trade and custom conquer table generators into a function so it's
not repeated all over the place


FEATURE FREEZE FOR 1.0 ------
      _______
_____/ FIXES \____________

- Got a "Game Start FAILED" but game still started properly ???

- Adjust for DST

- Showing warning about skipping turn when form is filled out
	might not be working on attack form...

- don't show success messages if email is not sent

- Notice: Undefined index: in /home/content/b/w/e/bwelker/html/webrisk/classes/game.class.php on line 1466 (1471)
	possibly due to being sent out of current state and skipping turn because of
	hitting conquer limit at exact end of game ???
	or some other forced end of turn situation at exact end of game ???

- do some general FoW testing and cleanup:
	when game is over, remove the fog
	make sure RA shows what it's supposed to be showing
		and knows what it's supposed to know (and nothing more)
		especially when one value is shown, and the other isn't
	check for bugs just after placement, for first player can
		see flash of unit placement, etc.
	there's a bug when a player resigns, he is visible to all

- maybe find a way to functionize (DRY) the conquer limit table
	as well as the trade value table

- look for TODO and fix all found

      __________
_____/ FEATURES \____________

- add nudge button when placing as well

- fog of war on cards

- build an install/update script



TODO
------------------
      _______
_____/ FIXES \____________

- clean up foreach loop queries in game list, and message list
	and anywhere else they might be

- general query optimisation, esp. in message center

- refactor to remove all require/include_once calls
	make some includes into classes so they get auto included
	when needed

- remove view data from classes

- separate game class into model and controller
	then there will in essence be two 'models'
	a DB model, and a game 'model'
	the DB model will pull and save all game data
	and the controller will perform all the in-between stuff

- maybe separate the other classes out into models
	and controllers as well

- check all the methods one by one for the game
	and gameplayer classes and make sure they
	are as close to in sync as possible

- figure out the cleanest method for Game::get_list
	and propagate to all scripts

- refactor classes and includes to be less dependant
	on each other

- break various class css into pieces for easier
	drag and drop into other scripts
	eg.- messaging, chat, etc.
	and then copy over to battleship, and pentago

- search for TODO and fix all found

      __________
_____/ FEATURES \____________

- ability to set starting number of armies

- ability to set how many cards equals a forced trade after conquering
	a player and collecting their cards, can be either 5 or 6

- have pre-set custom games, one click sets all relevant settings for
	that game
	- ability for users to create/save/edit their own, and have a big drop down list of them

- possible additions for subsequent players to alleviate first player
	advantage e.g.- second player gets 2 extra armies, third gets 3 extra
	etc.  but it stops after the first round (or optionally not)
	and placed either manually, or randomly

- add admin ability to delete lobby comments

- add game time limit, so players must take their turn
	in the specified time (in hours)
	if players do not take their turn in the specified time,
	it will be made for them.
	after three missed turns, they will be resigned.

- when deleting a message, don't go back to the
	message list, go to the next oldest message
	in whichever box you are in

- private chat with other players in game...
	maybe run an IRC style chat?

- implement a better random.org solution
	possibly grab a huge chunk of data
	split up and store in multiple little files
	(to save on memory when rolling dice)
	and read/edit little files, then grab a new huge
	chunk when little files drop below 20 or so
	use built in method if dice file not found

- make sure while surfing the site as another player- admin style
	it doesn't do anything destructive, like mark posts read, etc.

- make a game backup and restore button on the game page
	backup grabs all the database info for the game as it is
	at that moment, and restore puts it all back

- maybe implement some of the other rule variations

- make an email confirmation something or other to validate email
	addresses

- work on an invitation system add-on where they can send emails to
	people not registered with the system

- new maps including current map

- possibly set up an invitation table to avoid invitation flooding

- make admin controls to move armies, change players, give cards etc
	from within the game

- allow for different game methods (secret mission risk, 2-player
	buffer, capital risk, etc)

- change the colors to black, purple, red, yellow, blue, green (brown to purple, and
	change colors to be brighter)

- more ajax (allow for ajax occupy, so no page refresh between
	subsequent attacks)

- move all color type CSS to a color sheet, and consolidate the layout CSS

- write up list of required classes, etc, at top of each class file (see email)

- Continent Bonus multiplier - A variant so continents get a multiplier of how many
	armies a player gets by owning one. EG: If '3 x' and N.A. is owned, player gets
	15 instead of 5 only. Making '0' a possible multiplier would turn off continent
	ownership bonuses.

- "Team Play" A 4 or 6 player variant whereby players 1 and 3 (and 5) are partners
	and cannot attack each other and 2 and 4 (and 6) are the other 'team'. Stats
	could be turned off for these maybe or adjusted maybe.
	Maybe players could pass through allied occupied territory when attacking and/or
	fortifying

- "Big Bang" - Add a Multiplier for getting armies - EG: If a player is to get 3 at
	the start of a turn, a game setting can increase that using a variant. If a game
	setting was say '5 times' he would then get 15 instead of only 3 for example.
	This can make for insanely large armies. A low conquer rate here would be good.

- "End of Days" Add a variant so that players get their armies at the 'end' of their
	turns. EG: If at the beginning of a turn, a player is to receive 6 armies, these
	are held until the fortification stage. This will aid defenses.

- "The Dead man" Add an extra player in a game who gets territories and even armies
	each turn but he cannot attack. (It would equate to a resigned players armies and
	cards. The 'Dead' player could start with a few cards or automatically get cards
	every 'turn'. Other players could choose to attack him to try and get territories
	or his cards.
	An easy way to add this player would be to just have him as a player, then auto
	insert his armies, and then just 'retire' him. A card each round for him or just
	a few cards when he is created would be a bonus to try and eliminate him. This
	variant should be easy and would be the closest one for a 'bot' with little effort.

- Spies in fog of war games. Add ability once or settable number of times per turn to
	view either the color, number, or both for armies in a territory covered by fog of
	war. This will display the information once (in an alert), and then never again for
	that request.

- Game Variant Suggestions - "The Flop"  - All players cards are shown instead of hidden.
