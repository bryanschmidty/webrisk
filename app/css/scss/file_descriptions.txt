	SCSS File Descriptions
-------------------------------------------------------
layout.scss - the main layout file for the script
				this is here for my ease of syching styles between games
				this does not include game page or game specific styles

_game_layout.scss - the game specific layout for the script
				this includes any styles that are game specifc
				that are needed outside of the game page (invite page, etc)

game.scss - the main layout file for the game page
				this file is most likely game specific, but may have sections that
				are used in other games with similar layouts

_board.scss - the layout style for the main game board
				this is game specific for obvious reasons

_c_template.scss - the main color template for layout.scss

_c_game_template.scss - the main color template for _game_layout.scss

_c_game.scss - the main color template for game.scss

_c_board.scss - the main color template for _board.scss

there will also be several color theme files (c_red_black.scss, etc)
and each contains sections for each of the template files in order
from most reusable to least reusable (as shown above)
